Yet in computational hydrology the code and data that actually produces published results are not regularly made available, inhibiting the ability of the community to reproduce and verify previous findings. In order to overcome this problem we recommend that reuseable code and formal workflows, which unambiguously reproduce published scientific results, are made available for the community alongside data, so that we can verify previous findings, and build directly from previous work. In cases where reproducing large-scale hydrologic studies is computationally very expensive and time-consuming, new processes are required to ensure scientific rigor. Such changes will strongly improve the transparency of hydrological research, and thus provide a more credible foundation for scientific advancement and policy support.}, number={10}, journal={Water Resources Research}, author={Hutton, Christopher and Wagener, Thorsten and Freer, Jim and Han, Dawei and Duffy, Chris and Arheimer, Berit}, year={2016}, pages={7548–7555} }

The Geoscience Paper of the Future (GPF) presents an approach to fully document, share, and cite all their research products including data, software, and computational provenance. This article proposes best practices for GPF authors to make data, software, and methods openly accessible, citable, and well documented. The publication of digital objects empowers scientists to manage their research products as valuable scientific assets in an open and transparent way that enables broader access by other scientists, students, decision makers, and the public. Improving documentation and dissemination of research will accelerate the pace of scientific discovery by improving the ability of others to build upon published work.}, number={10}, journal={Earth and Space Science}, author={Gil, Yolanda and David, Cédric H. and Demir, Ibrahim and Essawy, Bakinam T. and Fulweiler, Robinson W. and Goodall, Jonathan L. and Karlstrom, Leif and Lee, Huikyo and Mills, Heath J. and Oh, Ji-Hyun and et al.}, year={2016}, pages={388–415} }

	abstract = {Experimental economists have joined the reproducibility discussion by replicating selected published experiments from two top-tier journals in economics. Camerer et al. found that two-thirds of the 18 studies examined yielded replicable estimates of effect size and direction. This proportion is somewhat lower than unaffiliated experts were willing to bet in an associated prediction market, but roughly in line with expectations from sample sizes and P values.Science, this issue p. 1433The replicability of some scientific findings has recently been called into question. To contribute data about replicability in economics, we replicated 18 studies published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics between 2011 and 2014. All of these replications followed predefined analysis plans that were made publicly available beforehand, and they all have a statistical power of at least 90\% to detect the original effect size at the 5\% significance level. We found a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study for 11 replications (61\%); on average, the replicated effect size is 66\% of the original. The replicability rate varies between 67\% and 78\% for four additional replicability indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to inventory heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the soils of Réunion (volcanic island in the Indian Ocean). Thirty-nine sampling sites were selected to account for the entire range of soils present on the island. From one to three layers of cultivated and uncultivated soils were sampled, with 84 soil samples analyzed overall. Réunion soils were found to be acidic (median pHwater=5.7) and heavy metal concentrations (median) were 0.15 mg/kg for Cd, 0.16 mg/kg for Hg, 52.9 mg/kg for Cu, 92.1 mg/kg for Ni, 146.1 mg/kg for Zn and 165.9 mg/kg for Cr. 83% of the soil samples studied had a Pb concentration below the detection limit (i.e. 0.75 mg/kg). We attempted to identify the heavy metal sources by assessing: (i) heavy metal distributions in soil profiles, (ii) heavy metal contents in cultivated soils relative to uncultivated soils, and (iii) relationships between soil heavy metal contents and the origin of the volcanic parent material. Cd and Pb distributions in the soil profile highlighted an impact of human activities. Volcanic eruptions could account for the high soil Hg concentrations, which ranged from 0.03 to 0.81 mg/kg. We demonstrated that the high soil concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were mainly due to the natural pedo-geochemical background.},

  abstract = {Organo-mineral complexes play a major role in the stabilisation of organic matter (OM) within soils, but only few data are presently available about the nature of the OM bound to mineral phases. In this study, we aimed at determining the nature of the OM present in various organo-mineral complexes in a tropical soil (Andosol). Organo-mineral complexes were isolated thanks to densimetric separation techniques. The mineral phases of organo-mineral complexes were identified using XRD, and OM was analysed by Py–GC–MS after carbon enrichment obtained through 5% hydrofluoric acid hydrolysis. We thus studied OM bound to poorly crystallised aluminosilicates (PC-AlSi), gibbsite and iron oxides, as well as free-OM (<1.9gcm−3 fraction), which represents OM that is not bound to mineral phases. In the organo-mineral complexes of the studied Andosol, lipids were mainly present with PC-AlSi while polysaccharides and proteins/amino acids were the main organic compounds associated with gibbsite. Lignin compounds were found in high quantities in free-OM but were not found in organo-mineral complexes. Only few organic compounds were bound to iron oxides. Furthermore, proteins/amino acids and lipids were also observed in all organo-mineral complexes, but polysaccharides were not. The present results show that mineral phase type influences not only the proportion but also the nature of the organic compounds present in organo-mineral complexes. This study provides new information about the nature of the OM bound to mineral phases, and will thus contribute to improving models of organo-mineral complexes in order to better understand OM stabilisation in soils.},

  abstract = {The importance of plant bio-cycling in the biogeochemical cycle of Si has been pointed out by recent studies. We analysed the litter and wood chemical composition of a lowland rainforest (Marelongue Reserve, Réunion Island, Indian ocean) not impacted by human activities, developed on a recent basalt flow dated ci 500years. The amount of elements stored in the above ground biomass falls within the range of tropical forests developed on moderately fertile older soils with Ca, K, Mg and Si values respectively at 1458kgha−1, 1506kgha−1, 246kgha−1and 17kgha−1. The estimated mineral uptake of the old trees gives a flux equivalent to 5±2% of the elements returned to the soil with litterfall. The four species that contribute the most to the litterfall with 70% of the leaf fall represent only 45% of the annual Si bio cycling. The result demonstrates that species that are not highly productive in a rain forest could be significant for the bio-cycling of parent-rock elements such as Si. A mass balance calculation shows that the dissolved silicon (DSi) issued from the dissolution of basalt is 1.8 times the DSi from litterfall. Here, the biogeochemical cycle of Si is characterized by a limited contribution of the bio-cycling compartment compared to other cases reported for rainforests.},
