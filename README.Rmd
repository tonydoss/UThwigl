# UThwigl

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/benmarwick/UThwigl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benmarwick/UThwigl) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/UThwigl/master?urlpath=rstudio)

The goal of UThwigl is to compute open-and closed-system uranium-thorium ages of geological and archaeological samples. It is based on the diffusion-adsorption-decay (DAD) model of Sambridge et al. (2012), which allows for advective and diffusive transport of uranium and thorium isotopes, while including synchronous radioactive decay.

The first function, `osUTh()`, will take the (^230^Th/^238^U) and (^234^U/^238^U) activity ratios collected along a transect perpendicular to the surface of the tooth or bone and return an age in thousands of years ago.

## Web application

The package includes a web application that runs in your browser where you can upload your CSV file, set the model parameters, run the model, and view the results. Choose this option is you are not familiar with R. Here's a screenshot of the web app:

## Run code without downloading anything 

You can run the package function in your browser by [starting a binder instance](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/UThwigl/master?urlpath=rstudio). This will open RStudio in your browser, together with the contents of this GitHub repository. 

## Installing the UThwigl package on your computer

To  install the development version of UThwigl from GitHub on your computer, run:

``` r
