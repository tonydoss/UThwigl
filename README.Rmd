# UThwigl

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/benmarwick/UThwigl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benmarwick/UThwigl) [![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/benmarwick/UThwigl?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/benmarwick/UThwigl)  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tonydoss/UThwigl/master?urlpath=rstudio)

The goal of UThwigl is to compute closed- and open-system uranium-thorium (U-Th) ages of
geological and archaeological samples. Closed-system U-Th dating follows the principles presented in  Edwards et al. (2003), Richards and Dorale (2003) and Ludwig (2003). Open-system U-Th dating is based on the diffusion-adsorption-decay (DAD) model of Sambridge et al. (2012), which allows for advective and diffusive transport of uranium and thorium isotopes, while including synchronous radioactive decay.

The function, `csUTh()`, calculates closed-system ages and uses <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U and <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U activity ratios on a single analysis to return an age in thousands of years ago. The <sup>232</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U or <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>232</sup>Th activity ratios are also needed for detrital correction.

The function, `osUTh()`, calculates open-system ages and take the <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U and <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U activity ratios collected along a transect perpendicular to the surface of the tooth or bone and return an age in thousands of years ago.

Please see the [vignette](docs/articles/uthwigl.pdf) for an example of how to use the functions in this package.

## Web application

The package includes two web applications: one that runs `osUTh()` in your browser where you can upload your CSV file, set the model parameters, run the model, and view the results, and a second app that does the same for `csUTh()`. Choose this option is you are not familiar with R. Here's a screenshot of the web app:

## Run code without downloading anything 

You can run the package functions in your browser by [starting a binder instance](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tonydoss/UThwigl/master?urlpath=rstudio). This will open RStudio in your browser, together with the contents of this GitHub repository. 

## Installing the UThwigl package on your computer

To  install the development version of UThwigl from GitHub on your computer, run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tonydoss/UThwigl")
```
